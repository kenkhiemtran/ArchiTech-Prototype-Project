ArchiTech - 3D Custom PC Builder (Mobile Prototype)
A mobile app prototype for an interactive 3D custom PC builder that features real-time component compatibility checks and part filtering. This project was developed for a System Analysis and Design course  and focuses on defining the system architecture, user flows, and data interactions for a full-scale application.


Key Features:


Interactive UI: Designed a prototype that allows users to select PC parts, view them in 3D, and receive instant feedback on compatibility.


System Modeling: Developed detailed system models, including use cases, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and domain models, to define system behavior.


Future-Proofing: Includes proposals for future-state enhancements, such as AR integration and social sharing features.

Technology & Methods:

Methodology: System Analysis and Design

Modeling: UML (Use Case, Activity, Sequence, Domain Diagrams)


Diagramming Tools: Visio / Draw.io
